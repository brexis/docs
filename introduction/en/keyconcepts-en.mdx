### API Key

**The API key** is like a secret password that allows your website or application to communicate securely with FedaPay. When you create a FedaPay account, you receive a set of keys: a private key and a public key.

* **Private Key** : This must be kept strictly confidential and is used to authenticate sensitive actions, such as transactions and fund management on your account. The private key is essential for direct integration of FedaPay into your systems, ensuring secure communication.

* **Public Key** : This is used for less critical actions, such as displaying information or initiating payments. For example, this key allows you to integrate ready-to-use solutions.

These two keys enable your system to communicate with FedaPay securely and reliably.

### Client

**A client** is a person or a company that pays you for a product or service you offer. With FedaPay, you have the ability to track and manage your clients’ information, including their names, email addresses, phone numbers, and transaction histories.

### Payment

**A payment** is the act by which a client transfers funds to the merchant in exchange for a good or service. This can be done through various means, such as credit card or mobile money. From the merchant’s perspective, a payment is the receipt of funds that completes a transaction, ensuring the purchase is settled.

### Transaction

**A transaction** refers specifically to a financial exchange between a client and a merchant, often materialized by a payment. Each time a client pays for a product or service, a transaction is recorded.

### Webhooks

**Webhooks** are automatic notifications that FedaPay sends to your website to inform you that an action, such as a successful payment or a refund, has taken place. It’s important to note that the events your system needs to “listen to” are predetermined by the merchant. This means the merchant decides which actions trigger notifications. Webhooks allow your system to react automatically to events, simplifying transaction management.

### Payout

**A payout** is a transfer made from the merchant’s FedaPay account to the client’s mobile money account. This enables the merchant to directly transfer available funds from their FedaPay account to a client, facilitating payments or refunds in a simple and secure way.

### Collect

**A collect** refers to the entire process of receiving money, generally within the context of a sale or service. A collect involves tracking payments you are expecting from your clients.

### Dashboard

**The dashboard** is the online interface where you can manage all your transactions, view your payments, and more. It’s your control center for everything related to FedaPay.

### Library

**A library** is a set of tools that simplifies integrating FedaPay into your website or application. By using a FedaPay library for languages like PHP or JavaScript, you can easily manage payments without having to code everything from scratch.

### API Response

This is the message that FedaPay sends back to you after you make a request via the API (for example, to create a transaction). It informs you whether the operation was successful or not and provides details such as the payment status.
