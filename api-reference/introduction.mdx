Each section in this reference corresponds to a key API feature, guiding you through its functionality with code examples, expected responses, and error-handling tips.

### Authentication

To ensure the security of your transactions, all API endpoints require **Bearer token authentication**. Your API keys grant access to your account's data, so keep them secure. Use the appropriate environment (sandbox or live) for development or production needs.

  }
]
