title: 'Payouts Management'

A payout is an operation that allows you to transfer money directly from your balance to a customerâ€™s account. This feature is designed for businesses that need to handle payments to specific clients.

### Steps to Create a Payout

Creating a payout through the API involves several steps. Each payout follows processes that must be respected to ensure smooth transfer.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payout Creation Request">
    To begin, you need to send a request to create a payout via our API. The essential information required in the request includes:

    * **amount** : The amount for the payout, always in whole numbers.

    * **currency** : The currency to be used for the payout. You can indicate the ISO code of the chosen currency (e.g., XOF for CFA francs).

    * **customer** : The customer receiving the payout. If the customer is not yet in your database, you can create them at the same time by providing details such as name, email, and phone number.

  #### Example of a request for creating a repository

    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript NodeJs
      const { FedaPay, Payout } = require('fedapay');
      FedaPay.setApiKey('YOUR_API_KEY');
      FedaPay.setEnvironment('sandbox');
      const payout = await Payout.create(params = {}, headers = {});
      ```

      ```php PHP
      \FedaPay\Fedapay::setApiKey(MY_API_KEY);
      \FedaPay\Payout::create(["amount" => 2000, "currency" => {"iso": "XOF"}]);
      ```

      ```Ruby Ruby
      require 'fedapay';
      FedaPay.api_key = '';
      FedaPay.environment = 'sandbox';
      currency = { iso: 'XOF' };
      payout = FedaPay::Payout.create(amount: 1000, currency: currency);
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Info>
      [Find more information in our API Reference](/api-reference/payouts/create)

      Sample code is available to simplify the creation of a repository via the API. Be sure to replace **YOUR\_SECRETE\_API\_KEY** with your sandbox or live private key.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sending the Payout">
    Once a payout has been created, it will be marked as **pending**. You then need to proceed with sending the payout. Two options are available:

    * Send the payout immediately.

    * Schedule the payout for later.

    <Info>
      [API code to send the payout](/api-reference/payouts/update-start)

      Use PHP, Node.js or Ruby code to send the repository, replacing **YOUR\_SECRETE\_API\_KEY** with your private key.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retrieve Payout Details">
    After creating and/or sending the payout, you can view its details to obtain specific information, such as status or payout history.

    <Info>
      [API code to retrieve payout details](/api-reference/payouts/get-by-id)

      Retrieve information on a specific repository using its unique identifier (ID). Replace **ID** in the URL with the ID of the repository you wish to consult.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payout Lifecycle

When a payout is created, it moves through several statuses:

* **pending** : Pending (initial status after payout creation).

* **started** : The payout has been validated and is in the process of being initiated.

* **processing** : The payout is being processed and sent to the recipient.

* **sent** : The payout has been successfully sent to the recipient.

* **failed** : The payout failed due to issues such as technical error or method-related problems.

You can track the status of your payouts from the FedaPay dashboard under the **Payouts** section.
