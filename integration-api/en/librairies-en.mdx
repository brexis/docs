FedaPay provides a suite of libraries for various popular programming languages and frameworks, simplifying the integration of payment solutions across different projects. These libraries streamline payment processes and help manage transactions within your applications. Here’s a guide on installing and using FedaPay libraries.

## Choose Your Programming Language/Framework

FedaPay offers libraries tailored for the following languages, each optimized for specific environments:

* **PHP** :  Ideal for backend applications and integrates smoothly with frameworks like Laravel or Symfony.

* **Node.js** : Suited for server-side applications and JavaScript APIs.

* **Ruby** : Built for Ruby applications, especially with the Ruby on Rails framework.

* **React.js** : Great for interactive frontend applications.

* **Angular** : Recommended for robust frontend application projects.

<Note>**Tip**: Make sure to select the library that matches your project’s language to ensure optimal integration.</Note>

## Installing the Library

Each FedaPay library installs via a standard package manager for the chosen language. Here’s an overview of the installation commands for PHP and Node.js:

<CodeGroup>

  ```Typescript NodeJs
  npm install fedapay --save
  ```

  ```Php PHP
  composer require fedapay/fedapay-php
  ```

  ```Ruby Ruby
  $ gem install fedapay-ruby
  ```

  ```Javascript ReactJs
  npm install fedapay-reactjs --save
  ```

  ```Angular Angular

  ```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>For complete installation instructions, refer to [the GitHub repositories for each FedaPay library](https://github.com/fedapay).</Note>

## Using the Libraries with API Keys

Once installed, configure the library with your API keys, which authenticate your requests. You can obtain these keys in the FedaPay dashboard.

<Note>**Best Practices**: Use separate API keys for development and production environments. This keeps your transactions secure and minimizes production errors.</Note>

## Testing and Validating the Integration

After configuration, perform tests in a development environment to validate the integration. For example, try creating transactions or retrieving customer information. This ensures that your integration works correctly before deploying it to production.

<Note>**Tip**: Test all functions and validate each step to avoid errors.</Note>

For detailed information on each function, refer to [the FedaPay API reference](/api-reference/introduction), where you can explore parameters and response structures for each request. There’s also an integrated test environment, allowing you to try requests and view real-time results.
