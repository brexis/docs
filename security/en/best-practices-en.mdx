title: 'Best Practices'
---

The security of transactions and the protection of customer data are essential for maintaining user trust and ensuring the integrity of your payment platform. Here is a comprehensive guide to strengthen the security of your applications and adhere to best practices for storing sensitive data.

## Securing Applications

In addition to the built-in security measures provided by FedaPay, it is important for each user of our service to enhance the security of their application or platform. Implementing protocols such as **TLS/HTTPS** and following good encryption practices are crucial to protecting your customers' data.

### Using TLS/HTTPS for Data Transmission

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is the protocol that ensures secure communications between the client’s browser and your server. Initially, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) fulfilled this role, but it has been replaced by TLS for enhanced security.

### Why Use TLS/HTTPS?

- **Data Encryption**: TLS encrypts all information exchanged between the client and the server, ensuring that sensitive data is not intercepted by third parties.
- **Server Authentication**: TLS verifies that the client is communicating with the authentic server and not with an impostor.

<Note>
**Example:** Payment pages must use TLS 1.2 or a newer version. This protocol secures the data flow and increases customer trust, which can even help improve conversion rates.
</Note>

### Setting Up TLS/HTTPS

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtaining a Digital Certificate">
    A digital certificate, issued by a certificate authority (CA), is necessary to configure TLS. This certificate assures users of your server’s authenticity.

    **Certificate Options:**

    - [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/): Free
    - [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/): Paid, recommended for advanced options
    - [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/): Offers certificates suitable for small and medium businesses

  </Step>
  <Step title="Installation and Configuration">
    Once the certificate is obtained, configure your server to use it. Refer to the installation guides from your chosen certificate authority to ensure correct configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration Verification">
    Use tools such as the SSL Labs Server Test to ensure that your TLS setup is secure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Account Security: Password Encryption and Credential Management

Protecting user passwords is crucial to securing your accounts and safeguarding your customers against unauthorized access.

### Importance of Password Encryption

Storing passwords in plain text in a database is a risky and strongly discouraged practice. Use hashing to ensure password confidentiality and protect your users from attacks.

<Note>
**Example:** In a multi-level system where each user has distinct privileges, unauthorized access can compromise the security of sensitive information (e.g., a technician should not have the same access as a director).
</Note>

### Password Hashing and Salting Protection

1. **Using “Salts”**: A salt is a key added to the password before hashing. This makes each hash unique, even for identical passwords.

2. **Password Hashing:** Use hashing algorithms like **SHA-256** instead of MD5 or SHA1, which are now vulnerable.

<Note>
**Example:** When a user creates an account, generate a unique salt, combine it with the password, and hash the result. By storing the hash and the salt, you significantly increase the complexity of rainbow table attacks.
</Note>

### Recommendations for Choosing a Password

- Use a strong password of at least 8 characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Do not reuse the same password for multiple accounts.
- Regularly update your passwords to minimize risks.

## Implementing Security Questions for Enhanced Protection

Security questions are an additional protection method for verifying user identity during password recovery.

### How to Choose Security Questions

- Choose questions with answers that are difficult to guess and known only to the user.
- Keep an option to update the security questions via the dashboard for additional security.

<Note>
**Example:** Select two questions from the list provided in your security profile and ensure the answers are confidential and not obvious.
</Note>

## Additional Best Practices

1. **Never Share Your Credentials**: Avoid sharing your password with anyone.
2. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Integrating a two-factor authentication solution greatly enhances account security.
3. **Account Monitoring**: Enable login notifications to alert users of suspicious access.

## Security Tips to Protect Your FedaPay Merchant Account

The security of your merchant account is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and protect your transaction data. Here are practical recommendations to strengthen your account security and reduce the risk of intrusion.

### Create a Secure Password

- Choose a password with at least 8 characters, including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters. A complex password is harder to guess.
- Avoid reusing the same password for multiple accounts. In the event of a data breach on another service, using a unique password for each account reduces the risk of access to your FedaPay account.

### Keep Your Password Confidential

- Never share your password with anyone, even trusted individuals.
- If you need to store your password, use a secure password manager.

### Protect Your Devices

Ensure that your computers, tablets, and smartphones are protected by a **firewall**, **spam filter**, **antivirus**, and **anti-spyware**. These tools will help you block intrusion attempts.

### Be Cautious of Unsolicited Emails

- Beware of unexpected emails and spam. Never click on links or attachments from unknown sources.
- Avoid responding to emails requesting confirmation of sensitive information, such as your credentials or financial details.
- Immediately delete any email that promises a prize or claims you were selected for a contest you never entered.

## Fraud Management Policy

Despite security measures, incidents of fraud can still occur. FedaPay has implemented a fraud management policy to protect both merchants and their customers.

### Examples of Possible Fraud

- **Unauthorized Transactions**: Fraudulent access resulted in transactions made from a customer’s account.
- **Declined Responsibility**: A customer claims they are not responsible for a purchase made on your site.
- **Delivery Issues**: The customer did not receive their purchase within the agreed timeframe.
- **Defective Product**: A customer dissatisfied with a product or service due to defects requests a refund.

### Our Commitment to Protection

FedaPay has designed a policy to handle these cases, protecting your interests while ensuring customer satisfaction. This approach promotes fair resolution for all parties involved, helping to maintain trust and transparently resolve disputes.
