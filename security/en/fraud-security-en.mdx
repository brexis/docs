At FedaPay, transaction security is a priority. We implement strict measures to detect, prevent, and manage fraud, ensuring the protection of both our merchantsâ€™ and customers' data. Through control mechanisms and partnerships with reliable financial institutions, we make sure each transaction is processed with full confidence.

## Fraud Detection and Management

### Merchant-side

* **Transaction Verification :** Each transaction is carefully analyzed by FedaPay's system to detect any suspicious activity.

* **Merchant Authentication :** When a merchant submits a payment request, FedaPay verifies that the request genuinely comes from the account owner.

* **Fund Management :** Merchant funds are securely held by a financial institution partner and are only transferred to the merchant's bank or mobile money account upon request.

### Customer-side

* **Bank Information Verification :** When a customer makes a purchase with a credit card, FedaPay collaborates with a **banking partner** to verify the authenticity of the card information. If the information is incorrect, the transaction is automatically declined.

* **Mobile Transaction Security :** For purchases made via mobile number, all transactions comply with **the security standards set by the BCEAO** (Central Bank of West African States). The customer must also validate each transaction by entering their **secret PIN**.

## Security Measures

FedaPay is committed to offering robust solutions to protect both merchants and customers from fraud. Here are the key measures:

* **Data Protection :** Sensitive information (such as bank details) is protected with encryption systems to prevent any data breaches.

* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) :** An additional security layer that requires users to confirm their identity via a second method, such as a code sent via SMS, an authentication app, or a verification email. This mechanism greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring additional proof of identity.

* **Real-time Transaction Monitoring :** Each transaction is monitored in real time, allowing any suspicious activity to be quickly identified and appropriate actions to be taken.

* **Collaboration with Financial Institutions :** FedaPay works closely with recognized banks and institutions to ensure payment security and compliance for both card and mobile transactions.

With these processes, FedaPay provides a secure payment environment, protecting both merchants and customers from potential fraud.
