title: 'Fraud and Security'

At FedaPay, transaction security is a top priority. We implement rigorous measures to detect, prevent, and manage fraud while ensuring the protection of our merchants' and customers' data. Through control mechanisms and partnerships with reliable financial institutions, we ensure that each transaction is conducted with full confidence.

## Fraud Detection and Management

### Merchant Side

- **Transaction Verification:** Each transaction is carefully analyzed by the FedaPay system to detect any suspicious activity.
- **Merchant Authentication:** When a merchant requests a payout, FedaPay ensures that the request is made by the account owner.
- **Fund Management:** The merchants' funds are securely held by a partner financial institution. They are only transferred to the merchantâ€™s bank account or mobile money account upon request.

### Buyer Side

- **Bank Information Verification:** When a customer makes a purchase using a credit card, FedaPay collaborates with a **partner bank** to verify the authenticity of the card information. If the information is incorrect, the transaction is automatically declined.
- **Mobile Transaction Security:** For purchases via mobile number, all transactions comply with the **security standards imposed by the BCEAO** (Central Bank of West African States). The customer must also validate each transaction by entering their **secret PIN code**.

## Security Measures

FedaPay is committed to providing robust solutions to protect both merchants and buyers against fraud. Here are the key measures:

- **Data Protection:** Sensitive information (such as banking details) is protected using encryption systems to prevent any leaks.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** An additional layer that requires the user to confirm their identity through a second method, such as a code sent via SMS, an authenticator app, or a verification email. This mechanism significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring an extra proof of identity.
- **Real-Time Transaction Monitoring:** Each transaction is monitored in real-time, allowing us to quickly identify any suspicious activity and take appropriate action.
- **Collaboration with Financial Institutions:** FedaPay works closely with recognized banks and institutions to ensure payment security and compliance for both card and mobile transactions.

Through these processes, FedaPay guarantees a safe and secure payment environment, protecting both merchants and buyers against potential fraud.
